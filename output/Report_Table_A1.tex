Primary dealers, 1960–2014.

The New York Federal Reserve Bank’s list of primary dealers. We have condensed the list slightly by combining
entries that differ due to name changes but maintain continuity in primary dealer role, most commonly due to the dealer acquiring another firm. However, we continue to list acquisition targets or merged entities separately for the period that they appear on the dealer list prior to acquisition.}
