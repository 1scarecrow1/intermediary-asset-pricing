Creation of Table 01 writeup:

The author sourced the historical list of primary dealers from the NY Fed's website, matching these dealers with data on their publicly-traded holding companies from CRSP/Compustat for U.S. dealers or Datastream for foreign dealers. Table 1 presents primary dealer designations as of February 11, 2014.

To replicate Table 1, we developed a code to automatically download the list of NY Fed primary dealers from the NYFed website, with an option to cache the list in an Excel file for future use. This cached list then serves as the starting point for the replication process.

The replication begins with data from the Excel file, utilizing two worksheets: one listing the primary dealers as of February 2014 and another documenting all primary dealers from 1960 to 2014, including their start and end dates. We aligned the 2014 primary dealer list with their start dates, carefully addressing discrepancies between the two Excel sheets, such as extra spaces or punctuation differences.  For dealers that paused their operations and later resumed, we considered their most recent start date. The process includes adjustments for these variances to ensure alignment with the original table. Start dates are organized from the earliest to the most recent. The author manually matched dealers to their publicly-traded holding companies. For the replication, a 'ticks.csv' file was generated and stored in the 'data/manual' directory, containing the mapping between primary dealers and their holding companies. This mapping was then used to add an additional column to the 'mergeddf' table, showing the holding company for each dealer. Prior to transitioning to the LaTeX format, we conducted unit testing to verify the accuracy of 'Primary Dealer' names and 'Start Dates' in Table01.mergeddffinal. This involved removing spaces and periods and applying specific naming exceptions to ensure the data matched expected results. Exceptions included renaming 'Bank of Nova Scotia, New York Agency' to 'Bank of Nova Scotia, NY Agency' and abbreviating 'Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated' to 'Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith'. Finally, we converted the table into LaTeX format using the tolatex() function, saving it in the output directory. This .tex file was then used to create the complete table in LaTeX format for inclusion in the report, replicating the entire table accurately.

Replicating Table 1 was a straightforward task, with the main challenge being to resolve name discrepancies across two worksheets. These discrepancies arose from differences in spacing, punctuation, periods, abbreviations, and variations between lowercase and uppercase in the data sourced from the NY Fed website. After addressing these factors, Table 1 successfully matched with the original data.
