Primary dealers as of February 11, 2014.

Primary dealers, as designated by the NY Fed serve as its trading counterparties as it implements monetary policy. Primary dealers are obliged to: (i) participate consistently in open market operations to carry out US monetary policy; and (ii) provide the NY Fed’s trading desk with market information and analysis. Primary dealers are also required to participate in all US government debt auctions and to make reasonable markets for the NY Fed. From 1960 to 2014, a total of 168 dealers were designated as primary ones, some of whom lost this designation previously. See {\color{blue} http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers.html} for current and historical lists of primary dealers.}
