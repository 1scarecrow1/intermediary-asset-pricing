This project of replication proved to be a fruitful endeavor. The most beneficial parts of this project were all of important computing concepts we used. We learned a lot about virtual environments, dependencies, command line, version control, and more. In addition, we were able to get some practice trying to replicating some somewhat complicated financial data, which will also be useful in our careers.
Going forward we are going to have a better idea of how to approach a project for our employers because we understand how important and difficult automation can be and things such as dependency management - this will make us more aware of these problems as we encounter them in the workplace.
