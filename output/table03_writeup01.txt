Table 3 shows the pairwise correlations between various capital ratios and macroeconomic indicators over the sample period from Q1 1970 to Q4 2012, using the data from CRSP-Compustat, Datastream, and several macroeconomic databases. 

The process of constructing Table 3 begins with the data from Table 2, ‘prim_deal_merge_manual_data_w_linktable,’ which assembles the comprehensive dataset for the primary dealers. This step involves curating the financial metrics—total assets, book equity, and market equity — to evaluate the market and book capital ratios of these entities. Also, A significant aspect of Table 3 is its engagement with the findings from Adrian-Etula-Muir (AEM), which underscored the predictive power of broker-dealer leverage on stock market returns. Table 3 extends the AEM’s idea by assessing the implied capital and leverage factor, which reflect broker-dealer book leverage's seasonally adjusted growth rate from the Flow of Funds data. Special attention was devoted to ensuring the dataset's readiness for factor and growth rate analyses, starting a year prior to 1970. 

After the data preparation, we calculated the capital ratios and transformed these ratios into analytical factors, employing AR(1) innovations. Market and book capital factors were defined as AR(1) innovations to the capital ratio, scaled by the lagged capital ratio. The AEM metrics were defined separately; the AEM implied capital as the inverse of broker–dealer book leverage from Flow of Funds used in AEM, and the AEM leverage factor (LevFac) as the seasonally adjusted growth rate in broker–dealer book leverage from Flow of Funds.

Next, we processed macroeconomic indicators such as earnings-to-price ratio (E/P), unemployment rate, financial conditions index, Real GDP and GDP growth, market excess returns, and market volatility. Like other datasets, the fetched macro dataset begins from a year before 1970 for the subsequent factor and growth rate computations. The E/P ratio is downloaded from a URL (Shiller’s dataset), and the market excess return is fetched from Fama-French research datasets. Others are pulled from FRED and CRSP.

Finally, the correlation matrices for Panel A and B are calculated to examine the relationships between financial ratios, macroeconomic variables, and factors. Panel A focuses on the levels of financial ratios and macroeconomic variables, and Panel B focuses on the factors derived from the financial ratios and their growth rates. We summarize our findings into tables for Panel A and B, alongside a figure illustrating how the capital ratios have shifted over time. All time series are standardized to zero mean and unit variance for illustration. We get our final table, which is converted to LaTeX and outputted to a .tex file.
